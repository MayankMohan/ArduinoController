# ArduinoController

Project by Mayank Mohan, Brandon Frale, and Dylan Vo

This repository contains all of the source code we created during the development
and testing of our project. If you wish to replicate our project, note that due
to rewriting the master code during a test session, while not wanting to adjust
the code on the main master code file, the correct file to upload to the master
arduino is the code in the COMTEST_MASTER folder. The glove code is in Hand_Slave,
and the Controller code is in Controller_Slave.

The Project writeup is also included in this repository
